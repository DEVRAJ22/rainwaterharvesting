    <p>Rainwater harvesting provides the independent water supply during regional water restrictions, and in developed
countries, is often used to supplement the main supply. It provides water when a drought occurs, can help mitigate
flooding of low-lying areas, and reduces demand on wells which may enable groundwater levels to be sustained. It also
helps in the availability of potable water, as rainwater is substantially free of salinity and other salts. Applications of
rainwater harvesting in urban water system provides a substantial benefit for both water supply and wastewater
subsystems by reducing the need for clean water in water distribution systems, less generated stormwater in sewer
systems, and a reduction in stormwater runoff polluting freshwater bodies.
A large body of work has focused on the development of life cycle assessment and its costing methodologies to assess the
level of environmental impacts and money that can be saved by implementing rainwater harvesting systems.
Rainwater harvesting provides an independent water supply during water restrictions. In areas where clean water is
costly, or difficult to come by, rainwater harvesting is a critical source of clean water. In developed countries, rainwater is
often harvested to be used as a supplemental source of water rather than a main source, but the harvesting of rainwater
can also decrease a household's water costs or overall usage levels. Rainwater is safe to drink.
When drought occurs, rainwater harvested in past months can be used. If rain is scarce but also unpredictable, the use of a
rainwater harvesting system can be critical to capturing the rain when it does fall. Many countries with arid environments,
use rainwater harvesting as a cheap and reliable source of clean water. To enhance irrigation in arid environments, ridges
of soil are constructed to trap and prevent rainwater from running down hills. Even in periods of low rainfall, enough
water is collected for crops to grow. Water can be collected from roofs and tanks can be constructed to hold large
quantities of rainwater.
In addition, rainwater harvesting decreases the demand for water from wells, enabling groundwater levels to be further
sustained rather than depleted.
