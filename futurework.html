      The future dictates that rainwater harvesting systems will need to be easy to retrofit, make use of water-storage space, eliminate the need for fossil fuel-driven pumping technology, offer protection against flooding, and be reliable. Business models for the en-masse provision of systems could include system leases and maintenance contracts, while a paradigm shift for consumers can be provided through authoritative Government leadership.<br>


      Many prototypes are being trialled that could pave the way for future systems. Modular, DIY systems that are reusable and recyclable are one example. There are also simple wall-mounted systems, and systems that collect rainwater runoff, part way down the roof, and deposit it in storage tanks hidden in the eaves. Many prototypes attempt to incorporate green spaces with water conservation through storage tanks that house a variety of plants.<br>
