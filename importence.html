      1. Rainwater harvesting or the collection of rainwater in a proper way, can be a permanent solution to the problem of water crisis in different parts of the world. This simple method can put forward a solution which will be workable in areas where there is sufficient rain but the groundwater supply is not sufficient on the one hand and on the other surface water resource is insufficient.
This is particularly applicable in hilly areas where it can be utilized for human consumption, by animals and also for farming. In remote areas, where surface pollution is comparatively low, rainwater harvesting is ideal.<br>
2. Although the earth is three-fourths water; very little of it is suitable for human consumption or agriculture. Rainfall is unpredictable and there is a constant shortage of water in countries which are agriculture dependent or generally drought prone.<br>
3. A bad monsoon means low crop yield and shortage of food. Even animals suffer from scarcity of water. Africa and the Indian subcontinent face acute water crisis during the summer months. The farmers are the most affected because they do not get sufficient water for their fields. Rainwater harvesting therefore is an ideal solution for farmers who depend on monsoon for consistent water supply.</p>
